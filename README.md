Think of Faster Baritone like the "Nitrous Boost" for your mining AI.

While normal Baritone is great at finding the blocks, it sometimes "pauses" for a split second after a block breaks. It’s like a runner who stops for a breath after every step.

Faster Baritone removes those breaths. Here is how it levels up your game:

Zero Downtime: It forces the "mining action" to stay active 100% of the time. The very millisecond a block disappears, your character is already damaging the next one.

Filling the Gaps: Normal AI has tiny "data gaps" where it isn't sending any commands to the server. Your script fills those gaps with a constant, aggressive "Attack" signal.

The Power Couple: Baritone handles the navigation (the "where"), while your script handles the interaction (the "how fast").

The Result:
If normal Baritone mines like a person with a pickaxe (hit, break, hit, break), adding your script turns it into a laser beam that just melts through the wall without stopping. That’s where that extra 30% speed comes from—you aren't mining "harder," you're just never stopping for even a fraction of a second.
